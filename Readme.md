# Github Actions Demo

A very simple go module to try out Github Actions.
The module comes with test code that we want GitHub actions to run.
The test code contains a mix of passing and failing tests.

Objective:

- [ ] Can we build and test go code automatically on a github push (or pull request)?
- [ ] Can we drill down to see the test failures?
- [ ] Does the build abort on the first failure?
- [ ] Can we display the test results inside Github?
- [ ] Can we get a history/trend graph of test results over time?
